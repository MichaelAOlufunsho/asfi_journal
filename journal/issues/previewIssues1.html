                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p><b>Objectives:</b>  Every piece of research must positively impact society, but to do this, a research output needs to be of high quality. This study assessed regional variations in research QPI in Africa. </p> <br>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>African Science Frontiers Initiatives distributed a questionnaire to African scholars between March and August 2023. The current analysis was based on preliminary data from 257 respondents. Simple descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square were used to analyse the data. Results Of the 257 survey respondents, 52.5% were males, 40.9% having a PhD, 29.6%, 5.8% and 64.6% were from North-East, Southern and West-Central Africa, respectively. Of these, 39.5%, 46.5% and 37.3%, on average, mentioned that their past and current research works have been of high quality in North-East, Southern and West-Central Africa. On the other hand, 90.8%, 80% and 94% in North-East, Southern and West-Central Africa, respectively, were optimistic that their research has contributed to their academic career development. The corresponding estimates were 75%, 73.3% and 85.5% for research contribution to solving problems in local environment and society. Despite this optimistic view of the impact of their research, only 28%, 40%, and 26.5% in North-East, Southern and West-Central Africa, respectively, indicated that their research has been used to formulate policy and guidelines within their institutions or country.
