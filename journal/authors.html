                    <h2>Author Guidelines</h2> <br>
                    <h4>Author Guidelines for ASFI Research Journal</h4> <br>

                    <b>Objective:</b>
<p>ASFI Research Journal is dedicated to publishing high-quality, original research that contributes to the advancement of knowledge within the African context. Authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts that adhere to the journal's standards of excellence, promoting scholarly discourse and contributing to the diversity of academic disciplines.</p> <br>

<h4>Open Access and Author Licensing</h4>

<p><i>ASFIRJ</i> uses the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/" target="_blank" style="color: blueviolet;">Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)</a> license type for the works it publishes. Under this license type, authors agree to make their articles legally available to be reused for any purpose without permission or fees. In this case, anyone can copy, distribute, or reuse <i>ASFIRJ</i> articles, as long as the author and original source are properly cited.</p> <br>

<h4>Article Publication Fee</h4>

<p>As an Open access journal, all contents published in ASFIRJ are made freely available to anyone anywhere in the world, perpetually. There is no subscription cost to access its content. To achieve this goal, <i>ASFIRJ</i> charges modest article processing fees (APF) to submitting authors across the article types <i>ASFIRJ</i> publishes. The modest APF recognizes the challenges African scholars may face in getting their papers published if higher fees are charged, many of them not having the required external funding to undertake their research. Thus, the APF are pegged to ensure publishing in <i>ASFIRJ</i> is as affordable as possible for every African scholar.</p> <br>

    <p>The names, email addresses, affiliations, and other contact details <i>ASFIRJ</i> might require from submitting authors or reviewers will be used for the usual operations of the journal when necessary, sharing with relevant partners for the purpose of production and publication. <i>ASFIRJ</i> takes responsibility to protect all personal information and contact details collected from all users in the journal’s operation and ensures that necessary steps are taken to maintain the security, integrity, and privacy of all personal data collected and processed. </p>
    
    <h4>Preprint policy</h4>
    <p><i>ASFIRJ</i> will consider for review and, if positively reviewed, accepts manuscripts previously published on preprint servers. Authors are also free to post the submitted version of a manuscript to a preprint server at any time during the review process. If and when the article is accepted and published in ASFIRJ, authors should update any pre-publication versions in the preprint servers with a link to the final published articles on <i>ASFIRJ</i> website.</p> <br>

   <h4>Manuscript Organization</h4> 
<p>Most manuscripts submitted to ASFIRJ should be organized as follows, except where advised otherwise in each manuscript type described below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manuscript titles</li>
    <li>Authors</li>
    <li>Affiliations</li>
    <li>Abstract</li>
    <li>Introduction</li>
    <li>Methods (or Methods and Materials)</li>
    <li>Results</li>
    <li>Discussion</li>
    <li>Acknowledgments</li>
    <li>References</li>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>
      Figures 
    </li>
    <li>Supporting information files are uploaded separately.</li>

</ul> <br>
	


<h4>Manuscript Titles </h4>
<p>Manuscript titles should be written in sentence case (only the first letter of the first word of the title, proper nouns, and other genus names should be capitalized). Authors should avoid the use of specialist abbreviations in the title if possible. For clinical trials, systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), the subtitle should indicate the respective study design.</p> <br>

<h4>Author Names and Affiliations</h4>
<p>All authors included in any submission must meet the criteria for authorship as specified in the international authorship policy recommended by ICMJE here. All authors should have made substantial contributions to the submitted work and should be accountable for the work. According to ICMJE recommendations, authors must all four criteria as given below: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data.</li>
        <li>Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content.</li>
        <li>Final approval of the version to be published.</li>
        <li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li><br>

        <p>On the title page, write author names in the following order:</p>
        <li>First name</li>
        <li>Middle name (or initials, if used)</li>
        <li>Last name (surname, family name)</li>
    </ul> <br>
    Names of author will be published exactly as they appear in the manuscript file. All authors should therefore ensure that names given in the manuscript files are correct. Anyone who contributed to the submitted work but do not meet the above criteria for authorship should be mentioned in the Acknowledgments. <br><br>

All authors included in a submission must have an affiliation. Usually, the affiliation includes department, university, or organizational affiliation and its location, including city, and country. Authors with multiple affiliations should include them on the manuscript title page, but only the preferred or primary affiliation should be included in the manuscript submission system. 

</p> <br>

<h4>Corresponding Author</h4>
<p>The author submitting the manuscript will be designated as the corresponding author in ASFIRJ submission system. The corresponding author will be the primary point of contact with ASFIRJ in all matters related to the submitted manuscript. He or she will be the only one among the manuscript authors who will be able to make any required changes to the manuscript during the review process. The corresponding author may wish to collate and include the ORCID ID of the authors in the manuscript file.</p> <br>

<h4>Changes to Authorship </h4>
<p>Prior to submitting their manuscripts, authors should carefully check the authorship list of their manuscript and provide the complete list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any changes to the authorship list, including addition, deletion, and changes in the order of names in the authorship list must be made before the manuscript is accepted and these changes must be approved by the journal editors. If authors would like to make any of these changes, the corresponding author should send an official request in that regard to the editor. The letter should include the following items: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation from all authors agreeing to the change. If an author is removed or added, the removed and added authors must confirm the change. Except in exceptional circumstances, the editor will not consider any changes to the authors list after the manuscript has been accepted. In such exceptional circumstances, publication of the accepted paper will be put on hold until the editor makes a decision on the change. If the manuscript has already been published online, any requests for change in the authorship list will result in an erratum if approved by the editor.</p> <br>

<h4>Cover letter</h4>
<p>Authors should note that the cover letter is usually the first part of the submitted manuscript that the editor reads and thus gives the first impression of the authors and their work. The cover letter must therefore be written with great attention. All submissions to ASFIRJ must be accompanied by a cover letter. Authors can adapt the following structure in writing their cover letter:</p>
<b>First paragraph: </b> <br>
<ul>
    <li>The title of the manuscript should be the title of the cover letter</li>
    <li>Give the rationale for the study and highlight the question the manuscript sought to answer</li>
</ul>
<b>Second paragraph:</b> <br>
<ul>
    <li>Briefly present what was done in the study and how it was done</li>
    <li>Present the key results and why they are important</li>
</ul>
<b>Third paragraph:</b> <br>
<ul>
    <li>Persuade the reasons why the readers of ASFIRJ should be interested in the work</li>
    <li>Take your cues from the journal’s aims and scope</li>
</ul>
<b>Fourth paragraph:</b> <br>
<p>All cover letters of works submitted to ASFIRJ should contain the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by another journal while being submitted to ASFIRJ.</li>
    <li>All authors report no conflict of interested to this submission, have read and approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to ASFIRJ.</li>
</ul> <br>

<h4>Conflicts of Interest </h4>
<p>All authors must disclose all financial relationships that involved the submitted work, including all sources of funding used to undertake their work, any commercial involvement that constitute a conflict of interest, any consultations, speakers' participation, stock or other equity ownership, patent arrangements, or employment. A statement of conflict of interest must be clearly stated in the manuscript file, after the Acknowledgments. It is the responsibility of the corresponding author collate each author’s statement and all authors should see and approve the complete disclosure before submission to ASFIRJ.
</p> <br> 

<h4>References</h4>
<p>Authors are required to do due diligence to cite relevant and update-to-date references in their work. All available references on a topic can be cited in the reference list and can include the following (1) published articles or manuscripts accepted for publication; and (2) papers on preprint servers that have citable DOI or preprint server’s URL. The following sources are not accepted as references: (1) unpublished work, including manuscripts not yet accepted in a journal; (2) personal communications; (3) retracted works. <br> <br>
    The reference list must include full bibliographic details for all works cited in the work. References should be listed at the end of the manuscript and numbered in the order that they appear in the text, listing the first six authors, et al. In the text, the reference number should be cited as a superscript. Authors should not include citations in the abstracts. 
    ASFIRJ follows the Vancouver reference style.</p> <br>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Tables should be placed at the end of the manuscript, after the reference list. Table titles should appear above each table with clear and descriptive information about the content of the table, usually starting with a label such as “Table 1”. In the manuscript text, tables should be cited in ascending numeric order upon first appearance (e.g., “Table 1”) immediately following the sentence or paragraph where the table is first cited. Tables can also be submitted as separate files if the authors wish to do so. Authors should place any explanatory or footnotes, and other text below the tables. </p> <br>

<h4>Figure captions</h4>
<p>Any figure included in the manuscript should be placed at the end of the manuscript, immediately after the tables or reference list if tables are not included in the manuscript. Figure legends should appear below each figure with clear and descriptive information about the content of the figure. In the manuscript text, figures should be cited in ascending numeric order upon first appearance (e.g., “Figure 1”) immediately following the sentence or paragraph where the figure is first cited. Figures can also be submitted as separate files if the authors wish to do so. Any explanatory or footnotes should be placed after the figure legend.

<h4>Research Letters</h4>
<p>Research letters is constitute novel or unexpected finding or observation or importance in a specific field and thus may have an immediate impact on the field. Research letters are considered as original papers, but are not extensive by nature to the extent of full original papers. Having said that, the review process of research letters is as rigorous as that of original paper. Research letters usually have no abstract and should begin with ‘To the Editor’. If an original paper submission is not considered significant enough to merit publication as a full article, ASFIRJ may ask authors to reformat it as a research letter. Supplementary information is not allowed for research letters. <br><br>

    <b>Word count:</b> 1,500 words <br>
    Maximum of 3 figures and/or tables <br>
    Maximum of 10 references</p> <br>


<h4>Correspondences</h4> 
<p>Correspondences are letters written concerning recent publication in the journal. ASFIRJ encourages such correspondences as this enhances interactions between article authors and readers and other experts in the field. Correspondences must be received within one month of publication of the original paper. If the editor considers the correspondence acceptable, the authors of the original paper will be invited to respond, and the response will be published alongside the correspondence. ASFIRJ accepts two types of correspondence letters: (1) correspondences that concern recent papers published in ASFIRJ, and (2) correspondence that concern recent papers published in other journals other than ASFIRJ. <br> <br>

    <b>Word count:</b> Not than 500 words. <br>
    <b>Title:</b> Have a short, relevant title that is different from the title of the original paper being discussed <br>

    <b>References:</b> Listed at the end of the letter with the journal article being discussed as the first reference  <br>
    <b>Graphics:</b> Have no more than one graphic presentation (table or figure) <br>
    <b>Begin with:</b> "To the Editor:"
</p> <br>



<h4>Systematic reviews and meta-analysis</h4>
<p>ASFIRJ encourages the submission of systematic review and meta-analysis papers. Systematic reviews can be accompanied with or without meta-analyses, which is determined by the nature and homogeneity of quantitative estimates collected during the systematic review process. Systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) require a comprehensive systematic search of the literature undertaken in multiple databases, usually covering many years, and appraisal of the quality of included studies. Systematic reviews should address a specific question or issue that is relevant for practice or policy in relevant topic and should provide an evidence-based, balanced, and high quality review on a focused topic. Systematic reviews being submitted in ASFIRJ  should be registered in appropriate platforms, e.g., PROSPERO or Open Science Framework, normally a priori before the research is conducted. Systematic reviews are published in ASFIRJ as original studies. All systematic review submissions should be accompanied by the relevant checklist, e.g., PRISMA, and follow EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines. <br> <br>

    <b>Title</b> <br>
    The title should be informative with less than 120 characters. Titles should include “systematic review” if no meta-analysis was performed, but “systematic review and meta-analysis” if a systematic review was performed. <br> <br>

<h4>Review articles </h4>
<p>
    Review articles present an update of the most recent developments in a particular field. They differ by the scope and level of analysis of the literature searches and the titles used from the systematic reviews. Although they do not usually require a rigorous literature search, they should rely on evidence and should be written by established experts in the field. <br> <br>

<b>Abstract:</b> 300 words (unstructured summary) <br>
<b>Main text:</b> <br>
Less than 4,500 words not including abstract, figure legends and references (please supply a word count). <br>
Additional unlimited online supporting information can be provided. <br>
Up to 200 references in the Journal's style. <br>
Figures and tables are important in review papers and up to 10 figures and/or tables (total) can be included in the text.

</p> <br>

<h4>Proofs</h4>
<p>After acceptance, all manuscripts undergo editorial check and proofreading to ensure that the journal standards and formatting requirements are met. We work to ensure that all articles are  published on time and accurately. Once the proofs are ready, the corresponding authors will receive an e-mail with the manuscript proofs. The author-corrected proofs must be returned within 48 hours of receipt of the email. The corresponding author should use the proofs only to check the typesetting, editing, and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Substantial changes to the article as accepted for publication can only be done with the permission of the editor. Proofreading is responsibility of the authors. Therefore, corresponding authors should pay careful attention when checking the proofs before returning it to the journal, as the journal cannot guarantee any other subsequent corrections. </p> <br>

<h4>Appeal of manuscript decisions </h4>
<p>Authors have the right to appeal all decisions of the journal. All appeals will be reviewed by the editors and their decisions on such appeals are final. Authors appealing their decisions should submit a written appeal to the editorial office, providing detailed reasons for the appeal, plus point-by-point responses to the comments provided by the reviewers and/or editors. If the appeal is accepted, it does not mean that the paper is accepted, rather the paper will be reviewed again, either by the editorial board or sent back to the original or new peer reviewers.</p>
